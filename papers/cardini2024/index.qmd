abstract: "Sponges commonly form associations within seagrass meadows, but their potential impact on seagrass productivity and nutrient cycles remains poorly understood. This study investigates the association between the demosponge *Chondrilla nucula* and the Mediterranean seagrass *Posidonia oceanica* in two sampling occasions during the plant growth (spring) and senescence (autumn) seasons at a small inlet near Naples, Italy, where the sponge grows conspicuously within the seagrass bed. We found a non-linear relationship between the benthic cover of the sponge and the seagrass, with higher *C. nucula* cover linked to intermediate *P. oceanica* cover, suggesting spatial dependence. *P. oceanica* showed higher net primary production (NPP) in spring, while *C. nucula* was net heterotrophic in spring but exhibited slightly positive NPP in autumn. NPP remained stable when the two organisms were associated, regardless of the season. *C. nucula* consistently contributed inorganic nutrients to the association in the form of phosphate, ammonium, and substantial nitrate, recycling nutrients that potentially benefited *P. oceanica* in its growth season. In return, the seagrass consistently provided dissolved organic carbon, which aided sponge nutrition in spring. These findings suggest reciprocal benefits in the interaction between *C. nucula* and *P. oceanica*, with nutrient exchange facilitating a facultative mutualism that potentially supports and stabilizes the productivity of the seagrass ecosystem."
