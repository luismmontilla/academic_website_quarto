If you happen to spend some time in Naples, you will probably have the chance to taste a coffee prepared by a Neapolitan friend in a moka machine. It is likely that you will notice that before serving, they will stir the coffee inside the moka. When asked, they will tell you is that coffee is more concentrated at the bottom of the moka than at the top. By stirring it, they are doing you a favour! This mixing not only improves coffee, but similarly happens in nature when layers of different gases or substances are stirred in the air and in the water due to turbulence. Here we will tell you a little bit more about our fieldwork in the *Posidonia oceanica* meadows off Ischia Island last September and how this is related to stirring coffee.
