I started my Ph.D. at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Italy as part of the Marine Symbiomes Research Group. As part of our project, we explored the idea that invertebrate-bacterial associations may have a relevant role in nitrogen transformation processes through activity of their associated microbiome. 

Using a combination of field surveys, incubation experiments, stable isotope probing, and high-throughput sequencing, we explored the taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbiome and the contribution of invertebrate-bacterial associations to biogeochemical fluxes of nitrogen at the ecosystem level.

During my Bachelor's at the Simon Bolivar University, Venezuela I joined the Experimental 
Ecology Laboratory, where I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's theses. There, the focus was on exploring ecological patterns and processes in coastal-marine ecosystems combining intensive fieldwork, manipulative experiments and multivariate data analysis.
